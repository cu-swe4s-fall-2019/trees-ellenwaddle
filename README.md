From https://rosettacode.org/wiki/AVL_tree#Python
The aim of this project is to compare search and insertion times required for key/value pairs of different data structure types: trees, AVL, and hash tables.
In avl_tree, there are two versions of AVL trees: avl.py was cloned from Ryan's github, while Ryan_avl.py is a version of mine that I adapted from example code online for extra credit. Either is usable, but I used mine (avl.py)
For the user's purposes, head straight to 'insert_key_value_pairs.py', where you can offer an input file where column 1 is keys, col 2 is values. I have two input files for you to test - one is randomly arranged, the other isn't. For each method you choose, the time it takes to insert your keys, find your keys, and total time is printed.
